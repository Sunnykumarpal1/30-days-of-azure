# 30-days-of-azure
My main goal is that i should prepare myself for Az-900 exam and learn the basics of cloud computing
 
# day 1 of azure 
 
# Introduction to cloud computing
 
 means the delivery of services over internet.If we need to increaes our   IT infrastructure we increase without even waiting to build new data centre.We can use cloud to rapidly expand our infrastructure. 
  
  Common services are:
  
     * virtual machine(vm)
     * storange 
     * data bases
     * networking
   Tradition services are:
   
       * IOT
       * Artificial Intellgence(AI)
       * Machine Learning(ML)
  
  
 
# The basic service provided by all providers are 
 1) compute power
 
 Compute power means how much processing our computer/system can do .

  Example :- If we have bought a computer with some storage capacity.Our  system will become slow as load on our system increases.So if we use cloud computing by which we can add or remove computing power based on our choice . In cloud computing we are only paying for services what we use.

2) storage power
 
 Storage power means how much volume of data we can stone in our system.
 
 Eg:- Normally the systems are with limited storage space in our system .As year passes we require more space in our system so for this we can't change system or upgrade
 instead of that we can use cloud computing . For which we just need to request for more storage from cloud  provider. Cloud computing makes the back up our system and keeps our Os Updated.
