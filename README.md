# 30-days-of-azure
My main goal is that i should prepare myself for Az-900 exam and learn the basics of cloud computing
 
#  DAY 1 of azure 
 
# Introduction to cloud computing
 
 means the delivery of services over internet.If we need to increaes our   IT infrastructure we increase without even waiting to build new data centre.We can use cloud to rapidly expand our infrastructure. 
  
  Common services are:
  
     * virtual machine(vm)
     * storange 
     * data bases
     * networking
   Tradition services are:
   
       * IOT
       * Artificial Intellgence(AI)
       * Machine Learning(ML)
  
  
 
# The basic service provided by all providers are 
 1) compute power
 
 Compute power means how much processing our computer/system can do .
  Example :- If we have bought a computer with some storage capacity.Our  system will become slow as load on our system increases.So if we use cloud computing by which we can add or remove computing power based on our choice . In cloud computing we are only paying for services what we use.

2) storage power
 
 Storage power means how much volume of data we can stone in our system.
 
 Eg:- Normally the systems are with limited storage space in our system .As year passes we require more space in our system so for this we can't change system or upgrade
 instead of that we can use cloud computing . For which we just need to request for more storage from cloud  provider. Cloud computing makes the back up our system and keeps our Os Updated.
 
 # DAY 2 OF AZURE
 OVER VIEW OF AZURE :-
 
    *Compute
    *Storage
    *Networking 
    *Migration
    *Devops
    *IOT
    *Analytics
    *AI
    *INTEGRATION
 
 For most application we need 3 core resources:-
 
     * Compute
     * Storage
     * Networking
 
   Compute contain :-

    Azure VMs
    Azure App Service
    Azure Container Instances
    Azure Kubernetes Service
    Azure functions
    
# 1) Compute;-

   i) Virtual Machine:- Azure VM are known as  IAAS(Infrastructure as a serivce).
      Eg;- If we are running an application on  on-premisi infrastructure we can move it to azure by Lift and Shift.
 
   ii)Azure app service
   
    * This is an PAAS(PLATFORM AS A SERVICE)
    * It lets us host web and applicatin without having worry  about the underlying infracture.
    * Sometimes we even us Vm when they are not web or mobile application
   
 iii) Azure Container instace
     *This are self containde software environment.
     
     *Container are like Vm except they don't contain Operating system.So it's weight is less than Vm so it's easiest way to deploy .
     *Container they run on Vm.
  
  iv) Azure Kubernetes services:-
  
    * It is known are Container Orchestrator.
    * It make easy to deploy multiple containers together
  
  v) Azure function 
  
    * it is microsoft main serverless offering
    * it is like azure app service
    * It executes the individual function rather than entire application .In this we only when the azure function is running.
